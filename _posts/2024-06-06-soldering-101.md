title: Soldering 101 — a picture-first guide for beginners
---

Welcome to soldering! This simple photo-style walkthrough keeps words short and leans on quick visuals so you can follow along without any jargon.

## 1) Set up safely

* Work on a steady table with bright light.
* Wear safety glasses and keep a small fan or open window for fresh air.
* Always park the hot iron in its stand on a heat mat.

## 2) Gather the few tools you need

* Small soldering iron (15–40W) with a clean tip.
* 60/40 rosin core solder, tip cleaner, helping hands, and alcohol wipes.
* Optional but helpful: tweezers, flush cutters, and a little extra flux.

## 3) Prep the iron — tin the tip

* Warm the iron for a couple of minutes.
* Wipe on brass wool or a damp sponge.
* Feed a tiny bead of solder until the tip looks shiny. A tinned tip makes heat flow fast.

## 4) Make a solid joint

* Hold the iron so it touches the pad and the wire at the same time (about 2–3 seconds).
* Feed solder where the iron meets the metals. Let it melt and flow; do not push hard.
* Pull the solder away first, then lift the iron. Keep the parts still while the joint cools.

### Quick professional tips

* Keep the tip clean every few joints with a quick wipe and re-tin.
* Use clips or helping hands so nothing wiggles while you work.
* If the joint looks dull or grainy, reheat, add a touch of fresh solder, and let it cool again.

## 5) Remove solder when you need to fix something

* Add a tiny bit of fresh solder or flux so the old solder melts smoothly.
* Place copper wick or a solder pump tip right on the molten solder.
* Heat for a moment, then lift straight up. Repeat with fresh wick if needed.

## 6) Finish cleanly

* Look for a smooth, shiny cone shape with no cracks or blobs.
* Swab the area with isopropyl alcohol to remove flux residue.
* Put the iron back in its stand and unplug it when you are done.

### Practice ideas

* Twist two scrap wires together and solder them until you get three shiny joints in a row.
* Move on to soldering a header pin onto a spare circuit board.
* Time yourself: most joints only need 3–5 seconds of iron contact.

That is all you need to start soldering with confidence. Keep the visuals nearby, take it slow, and enjoy building!
